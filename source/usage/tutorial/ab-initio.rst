Running the ab initio reconstruction
------------------------------------

Select the ``ab initio reconstruction``. This protocol is easy to use. Simply select the extracted particles and the PSF you just imported.

In this protocol you can change the *Expert Level* to *Advanced*. It allows you to modify more parameters, especially in the Reconstruction params tab.

This protocol will take some time to finish. To see if the run is doing well, go to the ``Output Log`` tab on the bottom panel.
Here you have ``run.stdout`` which prints all the commands that were called during the run;
and, more importantly, ``run.stderr`` which gives you the progression of the algorithm.

On line 52 here, you can see:

.. code-block:: text

    00052:   energy : 24078884957.1:   5%|â–Œ         | 1/20 [00:18<05:59, 18.92s/it]

which reads: 1 epoch over 20 was done in 18s. The approximate ending of the algorithm is in 5m59s.

When the protocol is finished, you will have 2 outputs:
 - a reconstructed volume that you can visualise
 - a set of particles with approximated rotations.
   Here the visualisation is the same as the raw extracted particles, but internally each particle stores a rotation found during the ab initio reconstruction.
   They will be used in the ``refinement`` protocol.

The reconstructed volume might not be aligned with the vertical axis.
To impose a cylindrical symmetry constraint during the refinement, we first need to align the volume with the `align axis` protocol!
