Extracting particles
--------------------

Now we will extract the particles from the images. For this, we have the ``extract particles`` protocol.
This one is fairly simple: select the coordinates you just generated with the ``manual picking`` protocol and hit *Execute*!

You can visualise the extracted particles the same way you visualised your images at the end of the :doc:`import-images` section.
