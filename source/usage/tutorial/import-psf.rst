Importing a PSF
---------------

To import a PSF, double-click on the protocol ``import psf``. Here, choose the path to the ``psf.tiff`` file in the examples folder. Fill in the acquisition parameter the same way you did with the images and execute the protocol.

You should be able to visualise the PSF the same way you did previously.
