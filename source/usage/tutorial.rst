**spfluo-app** is a software aiming at bringing single particle reconstruction to fluorescence imaging.

This tutorial will guide you through the app.

Whatâ€™s covered here:
    - Creating a project
    - Importing fluorescence images
    - Importing a PSF
    - Picking manually particles
    - Running reconstruction algorithms like ab initio and refinement
